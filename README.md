# FOOD ORDERING
Hello there! üí´I have created a food_orderingü•ówebsite that provides access to various sections including food, scrap, and dark web. Users can buy and sell any products. Sellers can modify orders via WhatsApp using [*@whatsapp-web.js*].

Initially, I created this website for my hostel canteen as part of a college assignment. However, some hostel friends uploaded inappropriate items like alcohol and guns, leading to canteen workers receiving orders for things like AK-47s. üòÇ

To address this issue, I've enhanced user authentication and implemented separate phases for different classes of users:üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
1) now i am using local Oauth2+localauth+mobilenumber verification [Whatsapp [required to place order /upload item]]. The author can keep track of user activity.[can also BAN‚ò† the user]
2) The items of particular category will automatically placed to there specific class based on it's content & photo [*@sieren phantom*]. 

### **sieren goupa** ü§ñIA bot working :
1) the messege is broken into words and then reorganized to make a meaningfull sentence(string). [also various string modifiers are used to improve PROMPT quality]
2) it fetches the VERB and ADVERB in a tree structural order-->NOUN and (PREP,CONJ). And then understands the meaning of the sentence.[i have implemented english, hinglish{mannuly} dictionary words for each part of speech]
3) Additionally, I use various string matching algorithms, such as Levenshtein distance.[ can understand human language]

## Sakh‚öïÔ∏è  
Sakh is a female bot created to chat with strangers. It uses a hierarchical dictionary of comments, messages, answers, and replies. If a response isn't available in its database, it generates one using methods similar to Sieren Goupa. Each connection creates a session, storing gathered data to provide realistic answers. The bot aims to connect emotionally with clients by using algorithms to generate emojis and adjusting response timing. It also updates according to the client's mood.  
~~_Testing and modifications are needed, but I'll be releasing it soon_ ü¶ß
